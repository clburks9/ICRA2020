Experiment Run #1:

Comparison Testing between two types of modal dynamics accounting in POMCP
Both methods embed modes as discrete states appended to the state vector
The difference is in how they handle counting of states for exploration

Method 1: Continue maintaining each nodes N(h) as a unified scalar count across modes
Method 2: Vectorize N(h), with one count per mode determining exploration

Experiment Run #1:

Comparison Testing between two types of modal dynamics accounting in POMCP
Both methods embed modes as discrete states appended to the state vector
The difference is in how they handle counting of states for exploration

Method 1: Continue maintaining each nodes N(h) as a unified scalar count across modes
Method 2: Vectorize N(h), with one count per mode determining exploration

Problem: Three modes will move according to a set 2-layer HMM. 
Modes: Stationary, Vertical, and Horizontal movement
States: 2 agent states, 2 target states, 4 total
Observations: Directional Observations from agent to target
Rewards: +10 for being within 1 meter of target
Bounds: 0,10 for each state

Hypothesis: Method 2 will show better preformance

Analysis: Average Time to Intercept, Total Number of Timesteps within reach, Distribution of gaps in capture
